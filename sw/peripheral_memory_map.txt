The peripheral starts at 0x4C00000 and has a 64K memory address range.
These are the mappings expressed as an offset:


RO 0x0000 : Version of the PL
RO 0x0004 : Configuration options for the PL (lsByte is number of EPUs)
RO 0x0010 : Processing unit ready states. 0 for ready, 1 for busy
RO 0x0014 : Index of the first available processing unit
RO 0x0018 : Signature result, when ready is 0 this is 0 for OK, 1 for invalid. If 
            there has been no previous signature, it will be 1

For each EPU:

0x0000 - 0x0040 : Signature
0x0080 - 0x00A0 : Public key
0x00A0 - 0x00C0 : RedHash
0x00C0 : A write of 0x410 will start processing. This register will read 0
         while processing, and read 1 for signature pass and 2 for signature
         failure

EPU's are mapped as

0x2000 - 0x2080 : EPU 0
0x2100 - 0x2180 : EPU 1
...
0x4000 - 0x4080 : EPU 32
